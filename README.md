# Fluid-vs-Responsive

I am going to explain here about the difference between Fluid/liquid layout and Responsive design layout.
| Fluid | Responsive |
| ------ | ------ |
| Fluid Layout is grid built with percentage. | Responsive layout is the combination of Fluid layout + Media Queries |
| all the values used are calculated that corresponds to the viewport size. |when resizing, the number of columns changes according to the available space |

Additionaly please check the below animation to find the difference between Reponsive and Adoptive design
